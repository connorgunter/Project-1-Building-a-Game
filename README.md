Title: BlackJack

Description: 
The player and dealer will start off with 2 cards each, one of the dealers cards will start facedown. The goal of the game is to achieve a score of 21 or lower by adding the values of your current cards. The player decides if he wants another card (hit) or if they are happy with their current cards (stand).The stand button will then tell the dealer to either hit if they need to or stand which will end the round. (The dealer always stands if their cards equal a total of 17 or more. If the player or dealer reaches 21, they have gotten a blackjack and win automatically unless the other also has 21, that is considered a push. If the player or dealer goes above 21 after they "hit" that is considered a bust and that is a loss for whoever "busted". If noone reaches 21 or busts, the one with the highest number will win

When a player wins or loses and the round(hand) is over, the white "NEW DEAL" button in the middle should be clicked if the player would like a fresh hand dealt to them, which will reset everything on the screen and deal 2 fresh cards to both the dealer and the player.
