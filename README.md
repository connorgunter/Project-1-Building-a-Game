the player and dealer will start off with 2 cards each (player gets one, then dealer(face down), then player gets 2nd card, then dealer gets their second) and then the player decides if he wants another card (hit) or if they are happy with their current cards (stand)

if the player or dealer reaches 21, they have gotten a blackjack and win automatically unless the other also has 21, that is considered a push

if the player or dealer goes above 21 after they "hit" that is considered a bust and that is a loss for whoever "busted"

if noone reaches 21 or busts, the one with the highest number will win
