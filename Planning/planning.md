I will be creating a game of BlackJack

To start I will have a main content container that holds everything

I will then include a container for the dealers cards

And another container for the buttons (hit, and stand)

and one last container for player cards (your cards)

I will then implement a shuffled deck of 52 cards, which gets dealt randomly every hand

I will create a function that deals the player a card, and then the dealer a card face down, and then the player again, and then the dealer face up

There will be another function for giving the player an option to hit or stand, which hit will deal another card and the player will get up to 11 hits

there will be another function for endgame which will end the game if the dealer or player wins

(I might add a wagering system after the basic game if I find I have time) -> player starts with 1000, and can choose how much to wager, and if you win you will 2x your wager, if you lose, you will lose whatever you bet
