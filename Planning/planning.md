I will be creating a game of BlackJack

To start I will have a main content container that holds everything

I will then include a container for the dealers cards

And another container for the buttons (hit, and stand)

and one last container for player cards (your cards)

I will then implement a shuffled deck of 52 cards, which gets dealt randomly every hand




(I might add a wagering system after the basic game if I find I have time) -> player starts with 1000, and can choose how much to wager, and if you win you will 2x your wager, if you lose, you will lose whatever you bet
